This project builds the IceTouch C++ Test Suite application for running tests with the
iOS simulator or on an iOS device.

You should use the "IceTouch C++ Test Suite iOS 7" target if you plan to run the tests on
an iOS 7.x device, use the "IceTouch C++ Test Suite" target otherwise. Bundles are not signed
with the iOS 7 target (iOS 7.x doesn't support loading signed bundles).
